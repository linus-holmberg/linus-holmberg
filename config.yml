    subtitle: "Hello! This is Samia! I'm a 4th year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University. My research interest is
     in the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Information Visualization,
     and Human-AI Interaction. I am currently a part of the Human-Centered Software Systems Lab at Purdue,
     working under the supervision of [Dr. Tianyi Zhang](https://tianyi-zhang.github.io/).

     <br><br>
     My research projects at Purdue tackles the socio-technical aspects of Large Language Models (LLM). I  empirically
     study the correctness and quality issues of LLMs, and build interactive tools that can aid end-users in analyzing and understanding
     issues such as misinformation or stereotypes hidden in LLMs.

     <br><br>
     Before coming to Purdue, I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Texas A&M University in May 2020.
     I completed my Bachelor's degree from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I grew up in the magical Dhaka city of Bangladesh.
     I love reading fiction ðŸ“–, and I'm a huge plant lover! ðŸŒµðŸŒ±
