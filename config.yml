  description: "Hi, I'm a <b>[Ph.D. student in Cognitive Science</b> at Linköping University (LiU)](https://liu.se/medarbetare/linho07), and employed as a [Ph.D. researcher at Jönköping University (JU)](https://ju.se/en/personinfo?sign=HOLLIN).
     <br><br>
    
     Broadly speaking, my research interest lies in making AI systems useful and understandable to all users. 
     One could say that my primary focus is in the intersection of Human-AI/Computer Interaction and Explainable AI, and that I use insights from cognitive science to inform my research.
     I do this under the supervision of <b>[Prof. Tom Ziemke](https://www.ziemke.se/)</b> (LiU), <b>[Prof. Maria Riveiro](https://ju.se/en/personinfo?sign=RIVMAR)</b> (JU), and <b>[Assoc. Prof. Serge Thill](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/thill-s)</b> (Donders Institue).

     <br><br>
     I obtained my first <b>MA in [Cognition & Communication](https://www.ku.dk/studies/masters/cognition-and-communication)</b> from the University of Copenhagen. 
     After that I studied a <b>MSc in [Data Science</b> at the University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/data-science-big-data), while simutaniously working as an <b>associate researcher</b> in a sleep research project at the University of Gothenburg.
