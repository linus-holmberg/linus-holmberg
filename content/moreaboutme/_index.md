## Wow, you wanted to know more about me... Sneaky little hobbitses. 

### Mostly Academic Stuff
* Even though I'm a PhD student at LiU I'm employed at JU in a research project called [XPECT](https://ju.se/en/about-us/school-of-engineering/organisation/computer-science-and-informatics/research-projects/xpect.html), led by __[Prof. Maria Riveiro](https://ju.se/personinfo.html?sign=RIVMAR)__.
<br><br>
* I have close collaboration with Psychology __[Prof. Sverker Sikström](https://portal.research.lu.se/sv/persons/sverker-sikstr%C3%B6m)__ (Lund University). His research group are developing __AI-based tools Cognitive behavioural theraphy (CBT)__ and __mental health assessment__. My role is to help evaluate the __Human-AI Interaction__.
<br><br>
* During my second master I worked in a __sleep lab__ under __[Assoc. Prof. Michael Smith](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/michaelsmith)__, where we investigated noice influence on sleep, cognition, and metabolites. 
<br><br>
* I finished my second master degree (data sceince) during my first year as a PhD student. 

### I do non-academic stuff too
* I used to workout... a lot, and I tried to get strong for real. Now I mostly play padel-tennis and lift some weights to minimize the physical and mental decay. 
<br><br>
* During my BSc I was elected to the student union council (Göta Studentkår). I realized that I'm not a fan of politics.
