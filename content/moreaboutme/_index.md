## Wow, you wanted to know more about me... Sneaky little hobbitses. 

### Mostly Academic Stuff
* I'm a PhD student at Linköping University, but I'm employed at Jönköping University in a research project called [XPECT](https://ju.se/en/about-us/school-of-engineering/organisation/computer-science-and-informatics/research-projects/xpect.html), led by __[Prof. Maria Riveiro](https://ju.se/personinfo.html?sign=RIVMAR)__.
<br><br>
* Since I never turn down an intereting oppertunity, I have multiple ongoinf colloaborations. Such as with Psychology __[Prof. Sverker Sikström](https://portal.research.lu.se/sv/persons/sverker-sikstr%C3%B6m)__ (Lund University). His research group develops __AI-based tools for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)__ and __mental health assessment__. My role is to help evaluate the __Human-AI Interaction__.
<br><br>
* We are also working on AI-based tools to support social workers with _risk assessments in custody evaluations_. 
<br><br>
* Simultaneously with studying for my second master’s, I worked in a __sleep lab__ under __[Assoc. Prof. Michael Smith](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/michaelsmith)__, where we investigated the influence of noise on sleep, cognition, and metabolites.
<br><br>
* I completed my second master’s degree (Data Science) during my first year as a PhD student. 

### I do non-academic stuff too
* I used to work out… a lot, and I tried to get strong for real. Now I mostly play padel-tennis and lift some weights to minimize the physical and mental decay.
<br><br>
* During my BSc, I was elected to the student union council (Göta Studentkår). I realized that I’m not a fan of politics.
<br><br>
* It is quite easy to make me happy, just make a LOTR reference.
